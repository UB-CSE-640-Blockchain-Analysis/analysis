## Updates as of 05/09/2022
- One needs to have a transactions.csv file in this folder which was obtained using the fetch repository in this organization.
- create_txt.py reads the graph.pickle generated by create_graph.py and creates a transactions.txt which will only have sender_id, receiver_id and timestamp. Sender_id and receiver_id are integer numbers. The mapping between integers and hashes is done and stored inside hash_to_int.pickle
- The txt file can now be used for motif counting

## Steps to do analysis (Added 04/25/2022)
- Clone the repository locally.
- The repository is compatible with python 3.8.5 and Networkx 2.8, so make sure you have them installed.
- Running create_graph.py should create graph.pickle file.
- Once graph.pickle is created, you can simply start using analysis.ipynb notebook for analysis.
