## Steps to do analysis (Added 04/25/2022)
- Clone the repository locally.
- The repository is compatible with python 3.8.5 and Networkx 2.8, so make sure you have them installed.
- Running create_graph.py should create graph.pickle file.
- Once graph.pickle is created, you can simply start using analysis.ipynb notebook for analysis.
